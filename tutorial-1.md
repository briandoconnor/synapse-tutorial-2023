# Tutorial 1: Synapse Basics

In this tutorial we're going to learn about Synapse and it's most basic features.

## Getting an account

First, let's create your account.  If you've already setup a Synapse account you can skip this step.

Start by navigating to the [registration page](https://www.synapse.org/#!RegisterAccount:0)

You can setup an account with either a Google-based account ("Sign up with Google") or using an email and selecting a password.

You'll get an email, you can then follow the link to set your account password.

You then will need to take the "Synapse Pledge", which includes agreeing to governance policies, privacy policies, terms of service, etc.

## Taking the quiz so you can upload

You need to become a "certified" user.  You can do this by taking the quiz [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Quiz:Certification)

The quiz is just 15 questions and should take < 15 min.

### Download Cart

This is where you can collect data files on Synapse that you'd like to download.  It helps you organize your access requests for data that is controlled access as well.

## Creating your first project

You will be dropped into your projects page, you'll see it's empty to start with.

Synapse projects are the main "containers" for information in Synapse.  They are workspaces where you can store data and share with other collaborators.  They start out as private and sharable with any other Synapse user but can, ultiamtely, be made public when it's time to share your results with the wider community.

Click create project, name it, and you'll be taken to the new project page:

## Adding wiki space content

You can add content to your project in the form of wiki pages.  These are written in a simple language called Markdown and allow you to create complex web pages containing graphics and tables using a simple syntax.

Start by clicking on the pencil icon to edit the wiki page.  You can then put in the following content:

```
## Test Project

This project space is a test

You can use simple formatting to make text **bold**, _italics_, or ~~strikethrough~~

You can make:

* bulleted lists

You can make:

0. numeric lists

You can even make tables:

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

Finally, you can make links, for example, here's more information on the [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) language.

```

You can see the result of this nicely formated when you save:

The Synapse project space is much more than a single page.  You can create a bunch of different pages, useful if your trying to organize your research results in distinct topics or collaborate with others on different parts of a project.  

To create another page, click the "Wiki Tools" button and then click "Add Wiki Subpage":

You'll now see a new page (in this case "Testing Page 2") appear in a navigation bar on the left.  In this way you can create multiple pages nested under each other, creating a potentially complex collection of pages with their own respective content.
