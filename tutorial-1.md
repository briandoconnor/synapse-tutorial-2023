# Tutorial 1: Synapse Basics

In this tutorial we're going to learn about Synapse and it's most basic features.

## Getting an account

First, let's create your account.  If you've already setup a Synapse account you can skip this step.

Start by navigating to the [registration page](https://www.synapse.org/#!RegisterAccount:0)

You can setup an account with either a Google-based account ("Sign up with Google") or using an email and selecting a password.

You'll get an email, you can then follow the link to set your account password.

You then will need to take the "Synapse Pledge", which includes agreeing to governance policies, privacy policies, terms of service, etc.

## Creating your first project

You will be dropped into your projects page, you'll see it's empty to start with.

Synapse projects are the main "containers" for information in Synapse.  They are workspaces where you can store data and share with other collaborators.  They start out as private and sharable with any other Synapse user but can, ultiamtely, be made public when it's time to share your results with the wider community.
