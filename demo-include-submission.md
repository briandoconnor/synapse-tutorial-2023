# Demo: INCLUDE DCC Submission

## Demo Instructions

* Open Synapse and show the [INCLUDE Test Project C](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn52171867/files/) - which can represent an INCLUDE Contributor site 
* Navigate to DCA ([this is the production instance](https://dca.app.sagebionetworks.org/))
* Within DCA use the DCA Demo DCC - this is equivalent to an INCLUDE DCC Hub 
* Select the INCLUDE Test Project C 
* Find the Biospecimen_Heart folder - it should be empty.  
* Select the Biospecimen Template
* Download - and in here you add a few lines of metadata - you can start with a blank space in the Tissue Status column (see screen shot) to show an error during validation
* Download as a CSV
* Navigate back to DCA - browse and upload the CSV you just saved
* Click Validate - show the error that you get.  
* Navigate back to the Google sheet and correct the error, save as CSV, upload, validate and submit.
* At this point you can go back to the Synapse project and show that the CVS has been submitted.  

## Submitter Instructions

## Submitter Synapse Project

Here's an [example Synapse Project](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn52171867/files/) that would be setup for a data submitter in INCLUDE.

It generates a template for you to submit data:


You fill in this google sheet and download as CSV... note I left out a required field:

You then upload this back to DCA, you'll see a summary and option to validate:

Click "Validate Metadata"

It tells you there's an error:

<img width="1431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/briandoconnor/synapse-tutorial-2023/assets/1730584/8f16e423-ee8d-4bc5-af6d-aac34ac78d50">

I'll correct the error and redownload as CSV:

Now I'll reupload to DCA and click the validate button again:

This time it passes validation and I'm giving the option to "Submit data":

And you get a success message along with a link to where in Synapse the file was submitted to:

And you can see the manifest stored on Synapse:
