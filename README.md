# Synapse Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials for using [Synapse.org](https://synapse.org) prepared for the Data Science for [Diverse Scholars in Down Syndrome Research (DS3)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uE9AS79CKm-6MUHmdXwdBwr-t9vQRmMjQY87ubY966E/edit#gid=1979379610) class held July 24 - August 4, 2023 in Boulder, CO.

* [Tutorial 1](tutorial-1.md) shows how to use the web interface to accomplish most the tasks a researcher would use Synapse for including data upload and sharing as well as team collaboration.

* [Tutorial 2](tutorial-2.md) shows very similar tasks but done programmatically with the Synapse Python client in a Notebook environment.

While we cover a lot of ground in these tutorials there is a lot of advanced functionality in Synapse that we couldn't fit into the tutorials.  Synapse has extensive [documentation](https://help.synapse.org/docs/) online where you can learn more and a [helpdesk](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/9) for asking questions.
